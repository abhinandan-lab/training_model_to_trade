✅ Week 1 – Data & Charting Setup
Goal: Set up MT5, get BTCUSD data, stream live prices, build real-time candlestick chart with drawing features.

Tasks:
 Install MetaTrader 5 terminal and connect to demo account

 Install MetaTrader5 Python package and test API connection

 Pull historical BTCUSD OHLC data for multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h)

 Stream live tick/candle data using MT5 API

 Store and cache candles in pandas DataFrame

 Build live candlestick chart using plotly or PyQtGraph

 Add basic chart overlays:

Trendlines (basic slope or HL/LL zones, swing/log swing high, horizontal lines)

Support/Resistance zones (based on candle structure or fractals)

✅ Deliverables:
Python script to pull and save BTCUSD candles

Real-time updating candle chart with auto-drawn S/R and trendlines

One-click script to launch this GUI with BTCUSD data
